# Detection of Food Adulteration Using Machine Learning
This project addresses food safety by leveraging machine learning algorithms to detect food adulteration. The system uses classification models to identify adulterants in food products based on a dataset. It also evaluates the performance of various algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Decision Trees.

## Features
- Utilizes multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Trees, to detect adulteration.
- Provides predictions on adulteration severity levels (Low, Medium, High).
- Includes data visualization tools for better insight into adulteration trends.
- Offers an interactive interface for real-time analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes:
- **Product Details:** Name, brand, and category.
- **Adulterants:** Type of adulterant detected.
- **Severity Levels:** Low, Medium, and High.
- **Health Risks:** Potential impact on health.
- **Actions Taken:** Measures to address adulteration cases.
