# Food-Adulteration-Detection
This project addresses food safety by leveraging machine learning algorithms to detect food adulteration. The system uses classification models to identify adulterants in food products based on a dataset. It also evaluates the performance of various algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Decision Trees.
