# Detection of Food Adulteration Using Machine Learning
This project addresses food safety by leveraging machine learning algorithms to detect food adulteration. The system uses classification models to identify adulterants in food products based on a dataset. It also evaluates the performance of various algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Decision Trees.

## Features
- Detects food adulteration severity levels (Low, Medium, High).
- Compares machine learning models for performance metrics.
- Visualizes data distribution and prediction outcomes.
- Provides insights for better regulatory enforcement.

- ## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Product details (name, brand, category).
- Adulterants detected.
- Severity levels of adulteration.
- Health risks and actions taken.
